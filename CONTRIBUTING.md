# Contributing Guidelines
## In general, please use conventional approaches to development and controbution such as:
- Create branches for major additions or deletions, or for side projects
- Use branches for testing and unstable additions
- Do not commit directly to master unless you have approval, use merge requests to indicate that an addition is ready to be made
- Use commit messages as a changelog only when changes are small, otherwise please use some other logging method and keep commit messages to version control

Main developers reserve the power to control the master branch
